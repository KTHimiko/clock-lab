# clock-lab — what has been found

## The question

Every longevity company sells a "biological age" test built on DNA methylation.
Blood composition shifts with age, and each cell type carries its own methylation
pattern. **Does a clock read how old the cells are, or who is in the sample?**

## The design that answers it

Reinius et al. (GSE35069) split one blood draw from each of six men into ten
fractions. Same person, same day, ten measurements.

**Any difference in epigenetic age between those fractions cannot be ageing.**

## Stage 2 — the result

Epigenetic age by fraction, averaged over the six donors:

| fraction | Horvath 2013 | Hannum 2013 | Levine 2018 | Horvath 2018 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CD4+ T cells | 34.4 | 41.0 | 17.3 | 39.5 |
| CD19+ B cells | 35.8 | 51.2 | 30.5 | 26.4 |
| Neutrophils | 36.1 | 47.5 | 30.9 | 32.8 |
| CD14+ Monocytes | 38.3 | 48.7 | 43.2 | 37.7 |
| **Whole blood** | **39.7** | **45.4** | **31.3** | **37.4** |
| CD8+ T cells | 41.2 | **24.3** | **6.2** | 34.7 |
| Eosinophils | 46.8 | **59.7** | 33.2 | 36.0 |
| CD56+ NK cells | 47.2 | 51.3 | 30.2 | 40.5 |

**Hannum reads 24 years for one man's CD8+ T cells and 60 for his eosinophils —
from the same tube of blood.**

### How much of the signal is not ageing

| clock | spread across fractions, within one donor | range | spread across donors | ratio |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Horvath 2018 | 4.5 yr | 15.1 yr | 13.8 yr | **0.33** |
| Horvath 2013 | 5.1 yr | 16.0 yr | 13.7 yr | **0.37** |
| Hannum 2013 | 9.9 yr | 35.4 yr | 13.6 yr | **0.73** |
| Levine 2018 | 10.7 yr | 37.0 yr | 13.9 yr | **0.77** |

The left column is measured **inside one person on one day** — it cannot be
ageing. The right column mixes real age with everything else.

**For Hannum and Levine, the variation between cell types within one person is
roughly three-quarters of the variation between different people.** The Horvath
clocks are about half as exposed, which is consistent with Horvath 2013 having
been fitted across many tissues rather than on blood alone.

### The sanity checks, fixed before the result was read

1. probe coverage — 100% for all four clocks
2. design — exactly 6 donors × 10 fractions, 60 samples
3. **PBMC must sit closer to whole blood than a random pair of fractions**, since
   PBMC is a subset of whole blood. Observed 2.16 years against 5.26 for a random
   pair. This is the check that would catch a donor mix-up, and it held.

## Corrections so far

| what was wrong | what caught it | what it cost |
|---|---|---|
| the original question needed cell counts GSE61151 never deposited | checking the metadata before analysing | the question, changed for a better one |
| metadata prefix strip guarded by `dtype == object`, which pandas 3.0 broke | every age coming back NaN | a validation run |
| four samples with ages 0, 6, 7 — `agegap` leaking into `agebloodtaken` | the validation gate refusing to pass | r of 0.89 reading as 0.68 |
| assuming the series had the paper's 573 samples | the file declaring 188 | an expectation, not a result |

Two of those returned plausible numbers without crashing.
